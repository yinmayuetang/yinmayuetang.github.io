<br>It is no exaggeration to say music constructs my life. Because my father is a music teacher, I started to learn various instruments in the early stage of my childhood. And now I can play piano, guitar, and hulusi.I think music has the power to let me focus on present and give me a sense of security. My favorite types of music are Jazz and Soul, which embrace me like a comfortable hug to let me chill out.
