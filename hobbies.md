## Music

Piano & Singing-Leave the door open

<br>It is no exaggeration to say music constructs my life. Because my father is a music teacher, I started to learn various instruments early in my childhood. And now I can play piano, guitar, and hulusi. Music has the power to let me focus on the present and give me a sense of security. My favorite types of music are Jazz and Soul, which embrace me like a comfortable hug to let me chill out.




## Photographing

<br>I enjoy capturing the lovely moments with pictures on my trip, which alleviates my anxiety, refreshes my soul, and leads me to discover the beauty of life. Every time I review the previous pictures, cheerful emotions and unforgettable memories are also brought to me, and I re-experience the precious feeling.
